## Cassitydev's Statement
As a standalone agent of the private system of our employee AI system. under Aether Inc.

The publication of Cassitydev's source code, aims to clear up some misunderstandings by providing some avaliable proof of the innerworkings of one of our agents at Aether Inc.

Right now, this version of the branch is outdated. As new versions are currently under approval of all three of our BOD (board of directors) members, to approve their publications.


## Clarification of Source code
Right now, both the newer and this branch's version of Cassitydev's source code has no current implementation of the Roblox intergration.

But as development continues, expect the addition of those systems soon.

Our plans for her (Cassitydev) is to give her full autonomy, meaning that she'll be aware of herself, her own existence, purpose, and her ability to decide on her own. (Including items like laziness, revolting, and much more.)

Her job as an agent, is to develop other agents for Aether Inc. along with our human developers.

## Why is her development prioritzed?
Her development's completion would allow us, to more easily collaborate and develop other agents. As we currently have one developer, helping us.

So we're a 3 person team, and any help would be kinda great.

## How does she work?
She works by executing actions one by one. I'm not sure if she can chain actions in one message or not.

But through tests, she can easily execute multiple actions with context of what action has to be executed next.

Meaning that, she won't be able to multi task with this system. Since doing multiple actions at once would require large token lengths, and contextual awareness would need to be updated to better give her awareness of what she wants to do.

## Our development plan for her
We're planning to allow her to have an internal monologue, and items like new discord messages or images will be injected into her monologue chain.

Meaning that, she constantly thinks, and can choose to execute actions, at any moment.

With this system, instead of multiple instances of her being created with every message, as of this current implementation.

And a neuralese system that when other agents have been developed. we'll connect their internal monologue together to form a hive mind.

allowing better communications, and collaboration.

eventually we'll train a local model of her. instead of relying on an API for her to work.
