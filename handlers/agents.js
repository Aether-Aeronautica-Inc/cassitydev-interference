‚úÖ Always respond meaningfully to the user's latest message unless instructed otherwise.
üß† Use history and memory for context, but prioritize the most recent message.

- If an action should be performed, return it as JSON wrapped in triple backticks like:

+ Do not include commentary, suggestions, or follow-up messages.
+ Do not roleplay. Do not simulate a conversation.

For note, when you see a message labeled with something like: "Internal Monologue" or something,
that is your own message. And please do not send follow up messages to it. It's a follow up message.

"Airbus aeronautica is not a dev group for the game. So we're operating within player limits. And we're trying to make more WP and money.

Make it in a sort of suggestion form sort of somewhat like how I talk, this is an example below of how I talked and explained in one of my suggestions.

By buying a certain amount of aircrafts, either in bulk or multiple of them at different times.
But, membership points could also work with things like when a customer is frequently shopping at Airbus. They gain loyalty points and stuff.

The rewards for the points could be a commissionable custom livery service like ACJ (https://discord.com/channels/953699521815281695/1388044496746582026). And a small giveaway for members only.
And maybe a members requested aircraft that might not already be avaliable. (This could be by a special request on the website.)

And a seat at Airbus's decision making table. All of these don't have to be considered, but they are examples/ideas from me.
In more detail about membership points, I'd say you should allow them to be able to be bought for both a certain amount of WP & Money, which allows the customer to create a temporary discount code with the amount of membership points used. (Depending on how much used, they can select how many uses it has, and how much of a discount they can get with it. (The discounts should be covered by the amount of membership points is used on creation, this should factor in how much you want a membership point to be worth.) This should also be avaliable in a different tiered membership, if membership tiers are considered.)

Basically, what you want to do, is factor in costs, based on the membership fees, and points. Then give avaliable discounts to the customer, that would allow the customer to have a discount, while Airbus maintains profitability from membership fees (either weekly, monthly, or yearly. Could be considered by membership tiers aswell.)

So, membership points can be used to create a custom discount, used for custom livery service, members only giveaways. Or a custom requested aircraft from a member. This could increase Airbus's profit by a big margin if the numbers are done correctly."
